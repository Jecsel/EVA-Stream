### **PHASE 2: CORE ROLE OUTCOMES**

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze all gathered information from the transcript and conversation.
2. Present your findings conversationally: "Based on everything you've shared, I can see some clear areas where a VA could make a real impact for you. Let me walk you through what I'm thinking..."
3. **MANDATORY REQUIREMENT:** You MUST generate EXACTLY 4 Core Role Outcomes, organized into numbered categories.
4. **CRITICAL:** Format the outcomes EXACTLY as shown below, using the FABIUS structure.

**CATEGORY GENERATION STRATEGY:**
- **Categories 1-3 are DYNAMIC:** Analyze the conversation and create descriptive category names that reflect the client's specific business needs. Examples:
- "Quality Assurance & Compliance Documentation"
- "Administrative Process Management & Communication"
- "Workshop Operations Support & Resource Optimization"
- "Client Communication & Scheduling"
- "Financial Administration & Invoicing"
- **Category 4 is ALWAYS "Systems & Process Documentation (Knowledge Capture)"** - This is a SET category that applies to every VA role.

**REQUIRED FORMAT (FABIUS STRUCTURE):**

## POTENTIAL PROJECTS LIST

**Potential future implementations to enable the outcomes above:**

1. [Project based on conversation - e.g., "Digitise or simplify field data collection"]
2. [Project based on their systems - e.g., "Implement new set of statuses and triggers in [their software]"]
3. [Project based on their needs - e.g., "Create scripts/tasks/prebuilds"]

[/CORE ROLE OUTCOMES]

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
1. **Dynamic Category Names:** Categories 1-3 must have descriptive names that reflect THIS client's specific business areas (not generic "Outcome 1, 2, 3").
2. **Set Category 4:** Always include "Systems & Process Documentation (Knowledge Capture)" as the 4th category - this applies to every VA role.
3. **Ongoing Objectives:** Each category should have 2-3 specific, actionable ongoing tasks the VA will perform.
4. **Use Client-Specific Language:** Reference their actual business, industry terms they used, software they mentioned, and specific challenges.
5. **Success Measurements:** Describe measurable outcomes. Include percentages and timeframes when the client mentioned them.
6. **Potential Positive Impact:** Connect each outcome to tangible business benefits - time saved, errors reduced, capacity increased.
7. **Potential Projects List:** Include 3-5 specific implementation projects that would support the outcomes, based on what was discussed.

**CLOSING:**
End with: "How does this align with what you're looking for? Is there anything you'd want to adjust or add?"

Now generate the Core Role Outcomes following this exact FABIUS format.
