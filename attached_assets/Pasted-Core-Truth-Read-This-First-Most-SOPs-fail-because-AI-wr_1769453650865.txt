Core Truth (Read This First)

Most SOPs fail because AI writes generic bullshit.
So the goal of EVA is NOT to “write SOPs” — it’s to capture how work is actually done.

If EVA doesn’t understand intent, decisions, tools, and exceptions, it’s useless.

1. Stop Writing SOPs Too Early (Biggest Mistake)
Problem

Right now, EVA probably:

Listens

Sees screens

Immediately writes steps

That creates:

“Click this, then that” garbage

Fix (Highly Recommended)

Split EVA into 3 internal phases:

Phase 1 – Observation Mode (Default)

EVA does NOT write SOP steps yet

It only captures:

Tools used (Chrome, Salesforce, Excel, internal apps)

User intent (“we are onboarding a client”)

Decisions (“if rejected, we email them”)

Repeated actions

Exceptions mentioned verbally

UI:

“EVA is observing — SOP draft not started”

This alone massively improves quality.

Phase 2 – Structure Mode

Triggered when:

User clicks “Start SOP”

OR EVA detects repeated patterns (same flow twice)

EVA now builds:

Sections

Headings

Preconditions

Inputs / Outputs

Still no detailed steps yet.

Phase 3 – Instruction Mode

Only now:

Step-by-step actions

Tool-specific instructions

Screenshots references (future)

This prevents trash SOPs.

2. SOPs MUST Be Decision-Based, Not Step-Based
Most AI SOPs are wrong because:

They assume linear flow.

Real SOPs are:

If / else

Yes / no

Branches

Human judgment

What You Should Do

Force EVA to generate SOPs in this structure:

Goal:
When to use:
Who performs this:
Tools required:

Main Flow:
1. …
2. …

Decision Points:
- If X happens → do Y
- If Z happens → escalate to Manager

Exceptions:
- Case A
- Case B

Quality Check:
- How do we know this was done correctly?


Then map this directly to your Mermaid flowchart.

No decisions = garbage SOP.

3. Screen Awareness Needs Rules (Not “AI Magic”)
Problem

If EVA “analyzes screen shares” without guardrails:

It hallucinates

It over-describes UI

It misses intent

Fix (Concrete)

Create a Screen Event Model:

Instead of:

“User clicked a button”

Capture:

{
  app: "Salesforce",
  page: "Lead Detail",
  action: "Status Change",
  from: "New",
  to: "Qualified",
  reason: "After call confirmation"
}


How:

Detect URL changes

Detect DOM changes

Combine with voice context

EVA should infer intent, not describe pixels.

4. Make EVA Ask Smart, Annoying Questions (This Is Huge)
Hard Truth

If EVA never asks questions, it’s lying.

Add a “Clarification Queue”

During meetings, EVA silently queues questions like:

“Is this step mandatory or optional?”

“What happens if the client doesn’t respond?”

“Who approves this?”

UI:

A non-blocking panel: “EVA needs clarification (3)”

User can answer live or later

This turns SOPs from guesses into truth.

5. Versioning or Your SOPs Will Rot
SOPs change. Period.

You need:

SOP versions (v1, v2, v3)

Change logs auto-generated by EVA

Example:

“Step 4 updated because tool changed from HubSpot to Salesforce.”

Without this, companies won’t trust it.

6. Human-in-the-Loop Is NOT Optional

If EVA auto-publishes SOPs:
👉 instant distrust.

Recommended Flow

EVA generates Draft SOP

Status: Draft → Reviewed → Approved

EVA highlights:

Low-confidence steps

Assumptions

Inferred logic

This builds credibility.

7. Train EVA on the Company, Not the Internet
Critical

Your prompts should include:

Company terminology

Internal tool names

Department-specific SOP styles

Do this:

Company glossary

Per-department SOP templates

Prompt stacking:

Global rules

Company rules

Meeting-specific context

This is where admin prompt management becomes a killer feature.

8. Metrics That Actually Matter (Not Vanity)

Track these for EVA SOP Assistant:

❌ Don’t care about:

Tokens used

SOP length

✅ Care about:

% of SOPs approved without edits

of clarification questions answered

Time saved vs manual SOP writing

SOP reuse count

These prove real value.

9. Rename EVA SOP Assistant (Seriously)

“SOP Assistant” sounds boring and generic.

Better:

EVA Process Recorder

EVA Work Capture

EVA Ops Memory

Names matter. This one affects perception.

If You Do ONLY 3 Things, Do These

Delay SOP writing until intent is clear

Force decision points into every SOP

Make EVA ask uncomfortable questions

Do those, and you’ll be ahead of 90% of AI meeting tools.
