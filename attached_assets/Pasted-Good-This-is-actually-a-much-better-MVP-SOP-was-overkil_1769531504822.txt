Good. This is actually a much better MVP. SOP was overkill for now. This version is clearer, easier to sell, and easier to ship.

I’ll be blunt and structure this cleanly so you can almost paste it into a spec.

New Agent: AI Meeting Assistant (EVA)

This agent is meeting-focused, not process-focused. One job: help humans not forget shit.

Core Concept (Simple, No BS)

EVA:

Listens to the meeting

Understands the agenda + uploaded docs

Answers questions by voice or text

Takes notes only when told

Produces a clean meeting summary

No SOPs. No flowcharts. Just meetings done right.

Activation & Control
Voice Trigger

Wake word: “Hey EVA”

Fallback: tap mic button (mobile-first, don’t rely only on voice)

Examples:

“Hey EVA, what’s this meeting about?”

“Hey EVA, take note of this”

“Hey EVA, did we miss anything important?”

Important:
EVA should respond by voice + text (voice can be toggled).

Inputs EVA Can Use
1. Live Meeting Audio

Who said what

Topics discussed

Decisions made

Questions raised but not answered

2. Meeting Agenda

User can:

Add agenda before meeting

Edit agenda during meeting

EVA uses agenda as:

Context anchor

Checklist for “did we cover everything?”

3. Uploaded Files / Documents

Supported (initial MVP):

PDF

DOCX

PPT

TXT

What EVA does with them:

Reads and understands the content

Links discussion back to the document

Detects:

Sections not discussed

Conflicts between doc and discussion

Talking points people skipped

What Users Can Ask EVA
Meeting Understanding

“What’s this meeting about?”

“Summarize the goal of this meeting”

“What are we trying to decide today?”

Coverage & Gaps

“What do we need to discuss again?”

“Did we miss anything from the agenda?”

“Which agenda items were not covered?”

“Was anything mentioned but not resolved?”

This is where EVA becomes actually useful, not just fancy.

Notes (Explicit Only)

EVA does NOT take notes automatically.

Trigger phrases:

“Hey EVA, take note of this”

“EVA, add this to notes”

“EVA, mark this as important”

What gets saved:

Timestamp

Speaker (if possible)

Short, clean note

No rambling transcripts. Just intentional notes.

Post-Meeting Summary (Auto)

After meeting ends, EVA generates:

Meeting Summary

Purpose of the meeting

Key topics discussed

Decisions made

Open questions

Missed or unresolved agenda items

Optional:

Voice playback using ElevenLabs

“Listen to summary” button

ElevenLabs Integration (Focused, Not Noisy)
Use ElevenLabs ONLY for:

EVA voice responses

Post-meeting spoken summary

Do NOT:

Read full notes

Narrate everything

Interrupt discussions

Voice should feel like:

“Helpful assistant, not a podcast host”

Agent Lifecycle

Meeting starts

AI Meeting Assistant agent enabled

EVA:

Loads agenda

Indexes uploaded docs

Listens passively

User interacts via:

Voice (“Hey EVA”)

Chat input

Meeting ends

EVA generates summary + optional audio

Clean. Predictable. Safe.

UI/UX (Mobile-First Reality Check)
EVA Panel Tabs

Ask EVA

Notes

Agenda

Files

Summary (appears after meeting)

Key Buttons

🎤 Hold-to-talk (mobile)

🧠 “Ask EVA”

📝 “Take Note”

🔊 “Voice On / Off”

Why This Is the Right Move

I’ll be honest:

This is sellable

This is understandable

This avoids SOP complexity

This fits meetings — not post-meeting bureaucracy

This makes ElevenLabs feel essential, not cosmetic

You can always add SOP later when users ask for it.
